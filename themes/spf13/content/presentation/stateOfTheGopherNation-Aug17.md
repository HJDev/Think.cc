I am at [GolangUK](https://www.golanguk.com) in London, having just finished giving the opening keynote.

I was a bit more nervous than usual, in part, due to the length of time
since my last talk, and in part I was representing the entire Go project
for the first time in a keynote.

This talk is an overview of the entire Go project. It covers "what we've done",
"why we did it" and "where we are going" as a project. It highlights our accomplishments, challenges and how the Go
Project is working on our challenges.
